The [Layered solution template](index.md) is fully configured for authentication. All the services and applications are configured to use the [OpenIddict](https://documentation.openiddict.com) library for authentication. They are configured in a common way for authentication. This document explains that common authentication structure.

If you choose the *Tiered* option while [creating](../../get-started/layered-web-application.md#creating-a-new-solution) the solution, the solution will have the `*.AuthServer` project.

## OpenIddict

[OpenIddict](https://documentation.openiddict.com) is an open-source library that provides a simple and easy way to implement an OpenID Connect server in your application. ABP has built-in modules ([OpenIddict](../../modules/openiddict.md), [OpenIddict UI **\***](../../modules/openiddict-pro.md)) to integrate OpenIddict into the solution.

## Domain Layer

The layered solution template *Domain* layer is the responsible for the OpenIddict definitions (Applications, Scopes, etc.). Also, it provides the *OpenIddictDataSeedContributor* class to seed the initial data. It creates the default clients (applications) and scopes for the solution.

The [OpenIddict UI **\***](../../modules/openiddict-pro.md) module is added only if you choose the OpenIddict UI  module while creating the solution.

The OpenIddict UI **\*** module provides a user interface to manage the OpenIddict entities such as applications, scopes, etc. You can manage these entities from the application UI.

## The Authentication Application

The solution may include an external authentication server (`auth-server`) application if you select the *Tiered* option during solution creation. Otherwise, the authentication server is integrated into one of the [Web Applications](web-applications.md).  

The authentication server handles token generation, validation, and user account management (e.g., login, registration). It uses the [Account](../../modules/account.md) or [Account Pro **\***](../../modules/account-pro.md) module. The [Account Pro **\***](../../modules/account-pro.md) module additionally supports [social logins](../../modules/account-pro.md#social--external-logins) (e.g., Google, Facebook). Social logins can be enabled, disabled, and configured directly from the application's user interface.

## Authentication Flows

Applications in the solution use different authentication flows depending on the application type:

- **MVC UI Web Application**:  
  Uses the [Hybrid Flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#HybridFlowAuth) (OpenID Connect Authentication) for user authentication.  
- **SPA and Swagger Applications**:  
  Use the [Authorization Code Flow](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth) to authenticate users.  

Once a user logs into the system and obtains a token from the authentication server, the `*.HttpApi.Host` application use [JWT Bearer Authentication](https://jwt.io/introduction/) to authorize the user's actions.
