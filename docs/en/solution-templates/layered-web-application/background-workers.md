Background workers are long-running processes that operate in the background of your application. They are ideal for non-time-sensitive tasks, such as processing data, sending notifications, or monitoring system health. Typically, background workers start when the application launches and run continuously until the application stops. For more information, refer to the [Background Workers](../../framework/infrastructure/background-workers/index.md) document.

Basically, you can create scheduled workers to run at specific time intervals based on your requirements. For example, you might create a worker to check the status of inactive users and change their status to passive if they haven't logged in to the application in the last 30 days.

```csharp
public class PassiveUserCheckerWorker : AsyncPeriodicBackgroundWorkerBase
{
    public PassiveUserCheckerWorker(
            AbpAsyncTimer timer,
            IServiceScopeFactory serviceScopeFactory) : base(
            timer, 
            serviceScopeFactory)
    {
        Timer.Period = 600000; //10 minutes
    }

    protected async override Task DoWorkAsync(
        PeriodicBackgroundWorkerContext workerContext)
    {
        Logger.LogInformation("Starting: Setting status of inactive users...");

        // Resolve dependencies
        var userRepository = workerContext
            .ServiceProvider
            .GetRequiredService<IUserRepository>();

        // Do the work
        await userRepository.UpdateInactiveUserStatusesAsync();

        Logger.LogInformation("Completed: Setting status of inactive users...");
    }
}
```

After creating a worker, you should also register it in the application. You might add it in the *Domain* or *Application* layer. You can register your worker in the `OnApplicationInitializationAsync` method of your module class:

```csharp
public class BookstoreApplicationModule : AbpModule
{
    public override async Task OnApplicationInitializationAsync(ApplicationInitializationContext context)
    {
        await context.AddBackgroundWorkerAsync<PassiveUserCheckerWorker>();
    }
}
```

> When scaling out your application in a distributed system, it's crucial to consider that the same background workers might run on multiple instances of the same service. This requires careful management of potential side effects. For example, if you're processing messages from a queue, you need to ensure that each message is processed only once. To prevent multiple instances from handling the same message, you can use [distributed locking](../../framework/infrastructure/distributed-locking.md).
