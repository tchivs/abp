This document explains how to store BLOBs (Binary Large Objects) in a single-layer solution. Storing files, images, videos, and other large objects is common in distributed systems. For more details, refer to the [BLOB Storing System](../../framework/infrastructure/blob-storing/index.md) documentation.  

In the single-layer solution template, the [Database Provider](../../framework/infrastructure/blob-storing/database.md) is used to store BLOBs in the database. The `Volo.Abp.BlobStoring.Database.EntityFrameworkCore` or `Volo.Abp.BlobStoring.Database.MongoDB` package provides the required implementations for storing and retrieving BLOBs in the database. This setup is integrated into the single-layer solution template and is used across all related projects. You can modify the database configuration in the `appsettings.json` file of the API project.

You can use the `IBlobContainer` or `IBlobContainer<T>` service to store and retrieve BLOBs. Here is an example of storing a BLOB:

```csharp
public class MyService : ITransientDependency
{
    private readonly IBlobContainer _blobContainer;

    public MyService(IBlobContainer blobContainer)
    {
        _blobContainer = blobContainer;
    }

    public async Task SaveBytesAsync(byte[] bytes)
    {
        await _blobContainer.SaveAsync("my-blob-1", bytes);
    }

    public async Task<byte[]> GetBytesAsync()
    {
        return await _blobContainer.GetAllBytesOrNullAsync("my-blob-1");
    }
}
```

## File Management Module

The *File Management* module is optional and can be added to the solution during the creation process. It provides a user interface for managing folders and files. For more information, see the [File Management *](../../modules/file-management.md) document.
