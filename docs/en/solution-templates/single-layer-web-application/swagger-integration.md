[Swagger](https://swagger.io/) is a tool that helps to create, document, and consume RESTful web services. It provides a user interface to interact with the APIs and also a way to generate client SDKs for the APIs.

In the [Swagger Integration](../../framework/api-development/swagger.md) document, you can find general information about Swagger integration with ABP Framework.
