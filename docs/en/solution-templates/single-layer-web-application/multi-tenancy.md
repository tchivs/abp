Multi-tenancy is a software architecture where a single instance(codebase) of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants. Tenants are isolated from each other and can have their own data, configurations, and users. This document explains how the multi-tenancy mechanism works in the single-layer solution template. You can learn more about multi-tenancy in the [Multi-Tenancy](../../framework/architecture/multi-tenancy/index.md), [Tenant Management](../../modules/tenant-management.md) and [SaaS **\***](../../modules/saas.md) documents.

## Multi-Tenancy in Single Layer Solutions

The single-layer solution templates use the *Multi-Tenancy* architecture only if you *Enable Multi-Tenancy **\**** option while creating the solution.

You can use different databases for each tenant or a shared database for some tenants. In the *SaaS **\*** module, you can specify the database connection strings in the [Connection Strings Management Modal](../../modules/saas.md#connection-string). All cached data is isolated by tenant. Each event, background job, and other data is stored with the tenant id.

You can use the `ICurrentTenant` service to get the current tenant information in your application.

```csharp
public class MyService : ITransientDependency
{
    private readonly ICurrentTenant _currentTenant;

    public MyService(ICurrentTenant currentTenant)
    {
        _currentTenant = currentTenant;
    }

    public void MyMethod()
    {
        var tenantId = _currentTenant.Id;
        var tenantName = _currentTenant.Name;
    }
}
```

Additionally, you can use the [DataFilter](../../framework/infrastructure/data-filtering.md#idatafilter-service-enabledisable-data-filters) system to disable the tenant filter and list all data in the same database.

```csharp
public class MyBookService : ITransientDependency
{
    private readonly IDataFilter<IMultiTenant> _multiTenantFilter;
    private readonly IRepository<Book, Guid> _bookRepository;

    public MyBookService(
        IDataFilter<IMultiTenant> multiTenantFilter,
        IRepository<Book, Guid> bookRepository)
    {
        _multiTenantFilter = multiTenantFilter;
        _bookRepository = bookRepository;
    }

    public async Task<List<Book>> GetAllBooksIncludingDeletedAsync()
    {
        //Temporary disable the IMultiTenant filter
        using (_multiTenantFilter.Disable())
        {
            return await _bookRepository.GetListAsync();
        }
    }
}
```
