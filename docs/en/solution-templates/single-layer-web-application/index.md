ABP Studio offers pre-architected, production-ready templates to quickly start a new solution. One of these is the Single Layer solution template, designed for building monolithic systems with minimal layers. It follows [Domain-Driven Design](../../framework/architecture/domain-driven-design) (DDD) principles and common application patterns. The template includes a single project, integrates existing modules, and provides host applications based on your selections, making it a solid foundation for your system.

> **This document explains the Single Layer solution template in detail. It is a reference document to fully understand the solution and refer to when you have trouble.**
