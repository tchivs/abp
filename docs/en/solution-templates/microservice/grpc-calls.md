## What is gRPC?

You can use [gRPC](https://grpc.io) to enable high-performance, low-latency communication between microservices. gRPC, or Google Remote Procedure Call, is an open-source remote procedure call system initially developed by Google. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication, load balancing, and more.

## Learning Resources

The microservice startup template hasn't any configuration related to gRPC communication. You can see the following resources to learn how to implement gRPC calls between your services:

* [Overview for gRPC on .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/) (Microsoft's documentation)
