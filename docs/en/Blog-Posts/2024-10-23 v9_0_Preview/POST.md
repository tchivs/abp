# ABP Platform 9.0 Has Been Released Based on .NET 9.0

![](cover-image.png)

Today, we are happy to release the [ABP](https://abp.io/) version **9.0 RC** (Release Candidate). This blog post introduces the new features and important changes in this new version.

Try this version and provide feedback for a more stable version of ABP v9.0! Thanks to all of you.

## Get Started with the 9.0 RC

You can check the [Get Started page](https://abp.io/get-started) to see how to get started with ABP. You can either download [ABP Studio](https://abp.io/get-started#abp-studio-tab) (**recommended**, if you prefer a user-friendly GUI application - desktop application) or use the [ABP CLI](https://abp.io/docs/latest/cli).

By default, ABP Studio uses stable versions to create solutions. Therefore, if you want to create a solution with a preview version, first you need to create a solution and then switch your solution to the preview version from the ABP Studio UI:

## Migration Guide

There are a few breaking changes in this version that may affect your application. Please read the migration guide carefully, if you are upgrading from v8.x: [ABP Version 9.0 Migration Guide](https://abp.io/docs/9.0/release-info/migration-guides/abp-9-0)

## What's New with ABP v9.0?

In this section, I will introduce some major features released in this version.
Here is a brief list of titles explained in the next sections:

* Upgraded to .NET 9.0
* Introducing the **Extension Property Policy**
* Allow wildcards for Redirect Allowed URLs
* Docs Module: Show larger images on the same page
* Google Cloud Storage BLOB Provider
* Removed React Native mobile option from free templates
* Suite: Better naming for multiple navigation properties to the same entity
* CMS Kit Pro: Feedback feature improvements

### Upgraded to .NET 9.0

We've upgraded ABP to .NET 9.0, so you need to move your solutions to .NET 9.0 if you want to use ABP 9.0. You can check [Microsoftâ€™s Migrate from ASP.NET Core 8.0 to 9.0 documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/80-90), to see how to update an existing ASP.NET Core 8.0 project to ASP.NET Core 9.0.

> **Note:** Since the stable version of .NET 9 hasn't been released yet, we upgraded ABP to .NET v9.0-rc.2. We will update the entire ABP Platform to .NET 9 stable, after Microsoft releases it on November 13-14 with the stable ABP 9.0 release.

### Introducing the Extension Property Policy

ABP provides a module entity extension system, which is a high level extension system that allows you to define new properties for existing entities of the depended modules. This is a powerful way to dynamically add additional properties to entities without modifying the core structure. However, managing these properties across different modules and layers can become complex, especially when different policies or validation rules are required.

**Extension Property Policy** feature allows developers to define custom policies for these properties, such as access control, validation, and data transformation, directly within ABP.

**Example:**

```csharp
ObjectExtensionManager.Instance.Modules().ConfigureIdentity(identity =>
{
    identity.ConfigureUser(user =>
    {
        user.AddOrUpdateProperty<string>( //property type: string
            "SocialSecurityNumber", //property name
            property =>
            {
                //validation rules
                property.Attributes.Add(new RequiredAttribute());
                property.Attributes.Add(new StringLengthAttribute(64) {MinimumLength = 4});

                //Global Features
                property.Policy.GlobalFeatures = new ExtensionPropertyGlobalFeaturePolicyConfiguration()
                {
                     Features = new[] {"GlobalFeatureName1", "GlobalFeatureName2"},
                     RequiresAll = true
                };

                //Features
                property.Policy.Features = new ExtensionPropertyFeaturePolicyConfiguration()
                {
                    Features = new[] {"FeatureName1", "FeatureName2"},
                    RequiresAll = false
                };

                //Permissions
                property.Policy.Permissions = new ExtensionPropertyPermissionPolicyConfiguration()
                {
                    PermissionNames = new[] {"AbpTenantManagement.Tenants.Update", "AbpTenantManagement.Tenants.Delete"},
                    RequiresAll = true
                };
            }
        );
    });
});
```

### Allow Wildcards for RedirectAllowedURLs

In this version, we made an improvement to the `RedirectAllowedUrls` configuration, which now allows greater flexibility in defining redirect URLs. Previously, developers faced restrictions when configuring URL redirects. Specifically, the `RedirectAllowedUrls` did not support using **wildcards (*)**, limiting how developers could specify which URLs were permissible for redirects.

With the new changes in [#20628](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/pull/20628), the restriction has been relaxed, allowing developers to define redirect URLs that include wildcards. This makes it easier to handle scenarios where a broad range of URLs need to be allowed, without explicitly listing each one.

```json
{
  "App": {
    //...
    "RedirectAllowedUrls": "http://*.domain,http://*.domain:4567"
  }
```

### Docs Module: Show Larger Images

As developers, we rely heavily on clear documentation to understand complex concepts and workflows. Often, an image is worth more than a thousand words, especially when explaining intricate user interfaces, workflows, or code structures. In recognition of this, we recently rolled out an improvement to the Docs Module that enables larger images to be displayed more effectively.

![](docs-image-larger.png)

Before this enhancement, images embedded in documentation were often limited in size, which sometimes made it difficult to see the details in the diagrams, screenshots, or other visual contents. Now, images can be displayed at a larger size, offering better clarity and usability.

> See [https://github.com/abpframework/abp/pull/20557](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/pull/20557) for more information.

### Google Cloud Storage BLOB Provider

ABP provides a BLOB Storing System, which allows you to work with BLOBs. This system is typically used to store file contents in a project and read these file contents when they are needed. Since ABP provides an abstraction to work with BLOBs, it also provides some pre-built storage providers such as [Azure](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/infrastructure/blob-storing/azure), [Aws](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/infrastructure/blob-storing/aws) and [Aliyun](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/infrastructure/blob-storing/aliyun).

In this version, we have introduced a new BLOB Storage Provider for Google Cloud Storage: [`Volo.Abp.BlobStoring.Google`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Volo.Abp.BlobStoring.Google)

You can [read the documentation](https://abp.io/docs/9.0/framework/infrastructure/blob-storing/google) for configurations and use Google Cloud Storage as your BLOB Storage Provider easily.

### Removed React Native Mobile Option From Free Templates

In this version, we removed the **React Native** mobile option from the open source templates due to maintaining reasons. We updated the related documents and the ABP CLI (both old & new CLI) for this change, and with v9.0, you will not be able to create a free template with react-native as the mobile option.

> **Note:** Pro templates still provide the **React Native** as the mobile option and we will continue supporting it.

If you want to access the open-source React-Native template, you can visit the abp-archive repository from [here](https://github.com/abpframework/abp-archive).

### Suite: Better Naming For Multiple Navigation Properties

Prior to this version, when you defined multiple (same) navigation properties to same entity, then ABP Suite was renaming them with a duplicate number.

As an example,let's assume that you have a book with an author and coauthor, prior to this version ABP Suite was creating a DTO class as below:

```csharp
public class BookWithNavigationPropertiesDto
{
    public BookDto Book { get; set; }

    public AuthorDto Author { get; set; }

    public AuthorDto Author1 { get; set; }
}
```

Notice, that since the book entity has two same navigation properties, ABP Suite renamed them with a duplicate number. In this version, ABP Suite will ask you to define a propertyName for the **navigation properties** and you'll be able to specify a meaningful name such as (*CoAuthor*, in this example):

```csharp
public class BookWithNavigationPropertiesDto
{
    public BookDto Book { get; set; }

    public AuthorDto Author { get; set; }

    //used the specified property name
    public AuthorDto CoAuthor { get; set; }
}
```

ABP Suite respects the specified property name for the related navigation property and generates codes regarding that (by removing the *Id* postfix for the related places):

### CMS Kit Pro: Feedback Feature Improvements

In this version, we revised the [CMS Kit's Feedback Feature](https://abp.io/docs/9.0/modules/cms-kit-pro/page-feedback) and as a result, we made the following improvements:

* A new **auto-handle** setting has been added to the settings page. When this feature is enabled, if feedback is submitted without a user note, the feedback is automatically marked as handled.
* You can now require users to enter a note when submitting negative feedback. This can be configured in the settings page, ensuring that users provide context when they submit critical feedback.
* We've added a feedback user ID that is saved in local storage. This allows you to track the number of unique users submitting feedback or determine if the same user is sending new feedback on updated documents.
