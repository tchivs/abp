# KB#0003: Can not login with the admin user

* Try username `admin` and Password `1q2w3E*`.
* Try to migrate database. If you have a `DbMigrator` application in your solution, use it. It will seed initial data and create the admin user for you.
* If not works, read the README.MD file in your solution, or check the [Getting Started](https://abp.io/docs/latest/get-started) document.
